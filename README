Documentation

This is a slideshow presentation software. It allows not only to show slides,
but also to connect from other computers in the network and watch the slides as
they change. This could be useful when no projector is available or just for
fun.

There is also a simple 140 characters limited chat.

If you login (default password is 'websockets!') you can change slides using
Space, Arrows, Home and End buttons. Other users can only watch and chat.

Communication between client and server is done via WebSockets. For JavaScript
abstraction JQuery is used. Server software is build on top of Mojolicous
framework.
